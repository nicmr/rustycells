# rustycells
A Basic cellular automaton in Rust


## What it does
Generates one-dimensional [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), processes their evolution to the next generation and prints them to the screen.

## How to run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicmr/rustycells.git
cd rustycells
cargo run
```
By default, it will first print 10 generations of the Sierpinski triangle to the screen, then 10 generations of a randomly generated vector.
